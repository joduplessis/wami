## API backend

GraphQL & Hapi API backend

## Global packages

-   Heroku CLI
-   Node v10.15.0
-   Npm v6.4.1

## Installation

All of the building happens with `npm`

### Dev server

The API is deployed to Heroku, so using the command `heroku start` has been the quickest to get things up. This will change to a NodeJS based workflow.

```
heroku start
```

### Populating the DB (options)

You can add any seed data to `seed.js`
